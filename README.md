# S-Block Community Commons

A federated, open-source Web3 toolkit empowering artists to co-create, remix, fund, and govern cultural content under Creative Commons licensing.

---

## ​ Overview

- **Federated Collaboration Layer**  
  Independent **S-Block hubs** can interconnect via **ActivityPub** (Fediverse standard), enabling content exchange, proposals, and shared governance—while preserving local autonomy and moderation.

- **Transparent Funding & Provenance**  
  Projects are crowdfunded on-chain; edits, remixes, and financial flows are immutably logged. Every creative fork is minted as an NFT with embedded CC license and full provenance trace.

- **Hybrid Participatory Governance**  
  Combines **on-chain DAO voting** with federated proposal tools. Contributors can propose, deliberate, and reach consensus locally or across hubs.

- **Open-Source DApp**  
  Built with modular smart contracts, intuitive UI frameworks, IPFS-backed media storage, and CC-compatible metadata schemas—all under permissive open-source licenses.

##  Innovative & Hacky Features

- **Federated Remix Lineage**  
  Creative remixes broadcast via ActivityPub, then tracked and minted on-chain—preserving license, authorship, and fork history.

- **Network-of-Networks Interop**  
  Builds resilient cultural commons by combining decentralized platforms (Fediverse) with blockchain trust, enabling cross-domain creativity.

- **Edge-First UX**  
  Peer-to-peer editing layer (e.g. using Holochain) enables creators to work offline or in low-connectivity contexts, then sync updates across the network later.

## ​ Why It Matters

S-Block models a new way for **cultural commons in Web3**—not just decentralized content, but a **federated, socially rich, interoperable ecosystem**. It unlocks **equitable participation**, **context-aware design**, and **shared cultural stewardship** through open source and Creative Commons ethos.

##  At ETHGlobal

We’ll prototype this federated DApp and demonstrate:
- Cross-instance content discovery and remix
- On-chain funding, licensing, and remix provenance
- Hybrid governance in action
- Reusable, open infrastructure for global creative collaboration

##  Get Involved

- Help develop and explore the smart contract logic, UI components, and metadata standards in `/contracts`, `/frontend`, and `/metadata` directories.
- Collaborate by testing federation flows via local ActivityPub instances using protocols like Mastodon or Pleroma.
- Join us to build, remix, and incubate the cultural commons of tomorrow!
